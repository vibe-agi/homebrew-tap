  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Hideout is installed but not configured. Review and create the supported
      default configuration with:

        hideout setup
        hideout doctor
        cd /path/to/project
        hideout run -- git status --short

      Setup does not start a VM or download the runtime. First run downloads
      the retained developer runtime separately; expect
      approximately 1 GB. Hideout user state remains under ~/.hideout and is
      preserved by brew upgrade and brew uninstall. To inspect or remove that
      durable state separately, run:

        hideout help uninstall
    EOS
  end

    assert_match "hideout #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/hideout version")
